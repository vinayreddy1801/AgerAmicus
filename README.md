# üåæ AgerAmicus ‚Äî AI-Powered Farming Assistant

An intelligent, multimodal AI assistant designed to empower farmers and agronomists with real-time insights, crop recommendations, and plant disease detection. Developed for the **Azure AI Hackathon**, AgerAmicus brings AI to the field with powerful yet accessible tools.

## üí° Inspiration
Modern agriculture faces critical challenges: crop diseases, unpredictable weather, and low yields. Smallholder farmers often lack access to timely agronomic advice. **AgerAmicus** was born to bridge this gap with an AI assistant that sees, understands, and responds ‚Äî just like a field expert.

## üöÄ What It Does

- üì∏ **Plant Disease Detection**  
  Upload a plant image ‚Äî get instant disease classification and confidence score.

- ü§ñ **AI Chatbot (AgroNLP)**  
  Ask anything! Get real-time recommendations on soil health, irrigation, pest control, and more.

- üìä (Coming Soon) **Yield Prediction & Fertilizer Engine**  
  Integrating soil/weather data for smarter planning.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

- **Frontend**: React-based UI (in progress)
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Azure OpenAI integration
- **Model**: Custom CNN model trained on the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease)
- **Chatbot**: GPT-35-Turbo via Azure OpenAI
- **Hosting**: Azure (OpenAI, App Services)
- **Dev Tools**: Python, TensorFlow, VS Code, GitHub Copilot
